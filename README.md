# üéµ Song Lyrics Translator  

**Author:** David Hern√°ndez  
**GitHub Repository:** [github.com/dahele16](https://github.com/dahele16)  

## üìñ Project Overview  
The **Song Lyrics Translator** is a Python-based application that automates the process of fetching song lyrics and translating them into a specified language. It leverages the Genius API for retrieving song lyrics and the DeepL API for high-quality translations, offering an intuitive and efficient tool for multilingual lyric enthusiasts.  

This project demonstrates API integration, data processing, and automation techniques, serving as an excellent showcase of skills in Python programming and real-world problem-solving.

## üîß Technologies Used  
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **APIs:**  
  - [Genius API](https://docs.genius.com/) for fetching song lyrics.  
  - [DeepL API](https://www.deepl.com/pro-api) for translating text into multiple languages.  
- **Libraries:**  
  - `requests` for API communication.  
  - `json` for data handling.  
  - Additional Python libraries as needed.

## üöÄ How to Run the Project  

### Prerequisites  
1. Install Python (version 3.7 or higher).  
2. Obtain API keys for:  
   - Genius API: [Sign up here](https://genius.com/signup).  
   - DeepL API: [Get an API key here](https://www.deepl.com/pro-api).  

### Setup  
1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/dahele16/song-lyrics-translator.git  
   cd song-lyrics-translator  
   ```  

2. Install required libraries:  
   ```bash  
   pip install -r requirements.txt  
   ```  

3. Configure the API keys:  
   - Create a `.env` file in the project directory.  
   - Add the following keys:  
     ```plaintext  
     GENIUS_API_KEY=your_genius_api_key  
     DEEPL_API_KEY=your_deepl_api_key  
     ```  

### Running the Application  
1. Run the main script:  
   ```bash  
   python lyrics_translator.py  
   ```  
2. Enter the song name, artist, and desired translation language when prompted.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works  
1. **User Input:** The user provides a song name and artist.  
2. **Lyric Retrieval:** The application uses the Genius API to fetch lyrics for the specified song.  
3. **Translation:** The lyrics are translated into the user‚Äôs chosen language using the DeepL API.  
4. **Output:** The translated lyrics are displayed to the user or saved as a file.

## üìà Future Enhancements  
- Add support for more translation APIs to provide users with alternatives.  
- Implement a GUI for enhanced user interaction.  
- Enable batch processing of multiple songs.  
- Include additional features like karaoke-style lyric timing.
